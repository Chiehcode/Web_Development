### What is the difference between a `Framework` and a `Library`?

* The defining difference between a library and a framework is `Inversion of Control`
* When you call a library, you are in control. But with a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls you. (all the control flow is already in the framework, and there's just a bunch of predefined white spots that you can fill out with your code.)
